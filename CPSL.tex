\chapter{Abstract}
CPSL (Compiler Project Source Language) is the programming language implemented in the Complier Construction course at Utah State University (CS 5300).
CPSL is a strongly typed, static scoped, block structured, high level language in the spirit of Pascal.

\chapter{Acknowledgement}
With permission, this work is largely derived from the CPSL language created for CS 5300 by Dr. Allan.  The mistakes are mine.

\chapter{Definitions}


The character set of CPSL is ASCII.
In the following \textit{letter} denotes any upper- or lower-case letter, and \textit{digit} denotes any of the ten decimal digits 0 through 9.

\chapter{Lexical Structure}
\section{Introduction}
The following is a detailed description of the lexical structure of CPSL.
Any lexeme not described herein is an error and should result in an appropriate diagnostic message.
\section{Keywords}
Keywords are strings with predefined meaning.  
They can not be redefined by the user.
These keywords are either all capitals or all lower-case, 
mixed-case variations are not keywords.
For example, BEGIN and begin are keywords while Begin is not.

\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{llllll}
array & begin & chr & const & do & downto \\
else & elseif & end & for & forward & function \\
if & of & ord & pred & procedure & read \\
record & repeat & return & stop & succ & then \\
to & type & until & var & while & write \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Keywords of CPSL}
\end{table}
\section{Identifiers}
Identifiers in CPSL consist of a letter, followed by a sequence of zero or more letters, digits, or underscores.
Upper- and lower-case letters are considered \textbf{distinct}.
There is \textbf{no limit} on the length of identifiers in CPSL.
\subsection{Predefined Identifiers}
CPSL has a small set of predefined identifiers.
Unlike keywords, the meaning of these identifiers may be altered by the user.

\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll|r}
Identifier & & Meaning \\
\hline
integer & INTEGER & Basic Integer type \\
char & CHAR & Basic Character type \\
boolean & BOOLEAN & Basic Boolean type \\
string & STRING & Basic String type \\
true & TRUE & Boolean constant \\
false & FALSE & Boolean constant \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\end{table}
\section{Operators and Delimiters}
CPSL has a set of symbols used as operators and delimiters.
These characters are not a valid part of any keyword or identifier.

\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cccccccc}
$+$ & $-$ & $*$ & $/$ & \& & $|$ & \textasciitilde & = \\
$<>$ & $<$ & $<=$ & $>$ & $>=$ & . & , & : \\
; & ( & ) & [ & ] & := & \% &  \\

\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\end{table}
\section{Constants}
\subsection{Integer Constants}
Integer Constants in CPSL are of three forms, each denoting an integer in a different base.
\begin{itemize}
\item A sequence of digits beginning with a 0 is interpreted as an octal number
\item A 0x followed by a sequence of digits is interpreted as a hexadecimal number
\item Any other sequence of digits is interpreted as a decimal value
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Character Constants}
A character constant represents a \textit{single} character and is enclosed in a pair of single quotes.  A character constant may not be blank, the lexeme consisting of a pair of single quotes is an error.
\subsection{String Constants}
A string constant represents a multi-character sequence and is enclosed in a pair of double quotes. String constants may not contain double quotes.
A string constant may be empty.
\subsection{Representing Characters in Character and String Constants}
The newline character (ASCII 10) may not appear between the single or double quotes of a character or string constant.
Any printable character (ASCII 32 to 126 inclusive) can be represented
as itself with the exception of \textbackslash.
Also such a constant can contain a \textbackslash followed by any printable character.  Such a \textbackslash - escaped sequence is interpreted as the character after the \textbackslash with the following exceptions:
\begin{description}
\item[\textbackslash n] line feed
\item[\textbackslash r] carriage return
\item[\textbackslash b] backspace
\item[\textbackslash t] tab
\item[\textbackslash f] form feed 
\end{description}



\subsection{Comments}
A comment in CPSL begins with a \$ and continues to the end of the line.
\subsection{Blanks, Tabs, Spaces, and New Lines}
Blanks, tabs, spaces, and new lines (white space) delimit other tokens but are otherwise ignored.  This does not hold inside character and string constants where such characters are interpreted as themselves.
